PHP Study Group
===============

The PHP Study Group meets weekly via Google Hangouts. It is a group of developers
who are interested in learning more about development and improving their coding
skills in PHP as well as in OOP and programming in general.

This repository contains the source code that was created during each session. It is
intended for learning purposes and in no way should be used as or representative of
production level code.
